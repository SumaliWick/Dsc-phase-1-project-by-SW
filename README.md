#Overview
In this analysis I have conducted a solid evaluation of performance based on the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to the film industry. This evaluation includes analysing performance metrics such as earnings, profitability, and customer ratings, while considering movies released and studio performance within a specific timeframe. Additionally, it provides insights into performance across different genres, volume, and overall industry performance.

This analysis entails gathering, processing, and interpreting data to gain insights into various aspects of the film industry's performance. It takes into account approximately 145,000 movies and 260 studios within the timeframe of 2010 to 2018. The results of this analysis would provide Microsoft with relevant insights & recommendations for making informed decisions regarding investing on a new movie studio.

#Evaluation
Intepreation of results

#Box Office Performance Overview:

It has becomes evident that studios such as BV, WB, Par, and Uni have emerged as prominent contributors to the movie industry, proven by their impressive domestic gross sales figures. Furthermore, when analyzing international markets, a similar trend emerges. In terms of production consistency, Uni, WB, Fox, Sony, and BV studios have demonstrated consistently releasing a substantial number of movies each year, thereby reflecting a sustained and stable output. WB, which has exhibited remarkable growth, 46% increase in total revenue and BV (Buena Vista aka Walt Disney) showed decrease of 10% in gross profit.

#Audience Engagement and Satisfaction:

WB, BV, Fox, Uni, Par, and Sony shine as the preferred choices for individuals seeking meaningful interactions and avenues to provide valuable feedback. When it comes to movie ratings, BV emerges as a standout performer with an impressive average rating of 6.9 following closely by P/DW and W/B. These ratings not only surpass the industry's average but also reflect the elevated satisfaction levels that audiences experience with the captivating and engaging content produced by these studios.

#Industry Performance & Profitability:

In recent years production costs increasing to a remarkable 8 billion in 2018 & gross profit to 2 billion. This substantial increase underscores the industry's resilience and potential for further growth. As per BCG metrix known as a star industry with high growth & high marketshare. From studios, PD/W takes the lead, garnering an impressive 374 million in earnings followed by BV 331 million, Gritindia 234 million and WB stands at notable 137 Million. Studies shows it will take at least 12 years to acquire maturity in the industry to generate postive NPV/ ROI creating own content/ studio without right partnerships often challenging.

Profitable Genres: Fiction, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Animation, Comedy, Fantasy, and Drama rise as the major contributors for revenue in the industry. BV seem have a distingused precense in Adventure, Animation, Comedy, Action, Adventure,Sci-Fis. WB seem to thrive Fantasy Genre along with Adventure.

Data Confidence I possess a strong level of confidence in the generalizability of my results beyond the dataset at hand. The completeness of data only applicable to 2018 hence it does not underly changes in industry beyond 2018 where circumstances have diversly changed due to global pandemic,consumer habits, economic situations and changes in streaming platforms.

Business use of model I believe this model can be adopted to identify performance in film industry as it analyses the key aspects of success to monitor. The measures taken into account are industry leading KPIs on which an investor would be focused on acquiring a new venture.

#Conclusions
Recommendation 1: Focus on acquistion over organic growth as it takes years to get established & face competitive environment. In relation to studio acquisition focus on Studio BV (Buena Vista) as a good choice followed by WB (Warner Bros). BV has more market share (both recent & past), better customer perception & profitability and more animation capability and proven success over creating high ROI titles (Quality vs Quantity). WB has same potential but currently operating slightly lesser scale compared to BV depending on the acquisition budget it would be a good second choice. This will also allow to acquire intellectual properties e.g. movie series with high & consistent revenue potential.

Recommendation 2: Consider investing more on Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi, Adventure, Animation, Comedy & Drama genres as they can become more profitable and have more revenue generating potential.

Recommendation 2: Microsoft can bring synergistic benefits to reduce increasing product budgets by introducing new green production techniques driven solutions, better resource management, cost effective equipment and adjusting crew size and skill mix without compromising on the quality and artistic vision of the project .

As part of the analysis we have not considered other factors that can create a profound impact on studios such as digital and home entertainment, critic reviews, demographics & geographics of consumers, academy awards & nominees. Including most recent data relate to 2019-2022 (post pandemic) and analysing consumer sentiments would further elevate this study's findings.
